# Overview
The exam_ML_H2.ipynb notebook serves as an exam and learning tool for mastering machine learning techniques. Users will engage with data preprocessing, training, and evaluating various machine learning models, as well as performing model optimization and tuning.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for handling missing values, scaling features, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data.
Supervised Learning Models: Implementation of classification and regression models such as Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and others.
Model Evaluation Metrics: Use of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and RMSE for model assessment.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Techniques for optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
Visualization: Data visualization to aid in data understanding and model analysis.

# About the Data
The dataset contains 15,000 entries and 19 columns, all of which have non-null values. Here is a brief summary of the columns:
id: Unique identifier for each entry.
Row#: Another numerical identifier, possibly to indicate the order.
clonesize, honeybee, bumbles, andrena, osmia: Numeric data related to different types of bees or insect populations.
MaxOfUpperTRange, MinOfUpperTRange, AverageOfUpperTRange: Temperature range features, presumably describing the upper temperature boundaries.
MaxOfLowerTRange, MinOfLowerTRange, AverageOfLowerTRange: Temperature range features related to the lower temperature boundaries.
RainingDays, AverageRainingDays: Data on rainfall frequency.
fruitset, fruitmass, seeds: Features potentially related to fruit growth metrics.
yield: the target variable, indicating yield output in some form.
